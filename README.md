# Search-Categorization

This was my undergrad major project which is based on K-means clustering algorithm. The aim of this project is to cluster the various links from searching input using algorithm.
For this we have used nano.xml file and Google Search API which provides us the Google Search links and then we categorize them using various constraints. 
For example, if we search for apple then apple can be a fruit or it can be a company or any other product. So, our project will display the results in various clusters such as 
one cluster contains all the links related to fruit and other cluster contains all the links related to the product or a particular company. 
Hence, according to the output of Google search we categorize them into different clusters.
